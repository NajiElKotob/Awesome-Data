# Let's Talk Data
* Data analytics is used for exploring data, extracting insights, and acting on those insights.
* Access to timely insights will ultimately lead to data-informed decisions.
* The data team must communicate with each other and be in dialogue with the business, to ensure solution development is responding to business needs and needs that may appear in the data.
* Structured data is familiar to most of us. Letters and numbers are organized into columns and rows for simplified search and processing. 
* Unstructured data is information that isn't organized in any discernable manner. Unstructured data is often more suitable for qualitative analysis and is stored in non-relational databases and data lakes.
* Understanding the difference between structured and unstructured data can determine where data should be stored and what kind of analysis is most appropriate.
* A data analyst enables businesses to maximize the value of their data assets. They're responsible for exploring data to identify trends, designing and building analytical models, and enabling advanced analytics capabilities through reports and visualizations.
* A data analyst processes raw data into relevant insights based on identified business requirements.
* Successful data analysts need a combination of technical and soft skills (Communication; Process management; Problem solving; Collaboration and team work; Creativity; etc.) to solve problems and deliver actionable insights.
* Business Intelligence => modern analytics
* Building a data culture, building a center of excellence, and supporting analytics practitioners with a community of practice are only a few strategies to ensure that analytics will scale throughout your organization.

  * Descriptive analytics, which answers the question “What is happening in my business?”. The data to answer this question is typically answered through the creation of a data warehouse in which historical data is persisted in relational tables for multidimensional modeling and reporting.
  * Diagnostic analytics, which deals with answering the question “Why is it happening?”. This may involve exploring information that already exists in a data warehouse, but typically involves a wider search of your data estate to find more data to support this type of analysis.
  * Predictive analytics, which enables you to answer the question “What is likely to happen in the future based on previous trends and patterns?”
