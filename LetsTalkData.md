* Access to timely insights will ultimately lead to data-informed decisions.
* The data team must communicate with each other and be in dialogue with the business, to ensure solution development is responding to business needs and needs that may appear in the data.
* Structured data is familiar to most of us. Letters and numbers are organized into columns and rows for simplified search and processing. 
* Unstructured data is information that isn't organized in any discernable manner. Unstructured data is often more suitable for qualitative analysis and is stored in non-relational databases and data lakes.
* Understanding the difference between structured and unstructured data can determine where data should be stored and what kind of analysis is most appropriate.
